------------

To get this to compile, I had to define the QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENCL and
QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENCL variables. Running "qmake -set" didn't work so
I added them to the qmake.conf file referenced by the QMAKESPEC. 
Here are the lines that I added:

QMAKE_INCDIR_OPENCL = "C:/Program Files (x86)/ATI Stream/include"
QMAKE_LIBDIR_OPENCL = "C:/Program Files (x86)/ATI Stream/lib/x86_64"

Building
--------

qmake opencl.pro
nmake release
